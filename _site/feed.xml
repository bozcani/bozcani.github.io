        <title>throwback: My Senior Design Project: Non Contact Baby Monitoring System</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;We designed a senior design project as a group of four in 2015-2016. In this project, vitals signs of a baby such as heart rate, respiration rate and body temperature were monitored by using thermal camera only and parents were notified about them via mobile application. We used Raspberry Pi Model B as intermediate device. Thermal camera camera captured thermal frames and Raspberry processed them realtime. MongoDB is used as storage the data coming from Raspberry. An android mobile application is used as end-user product.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can see detailed information &lt;a href=&quot;https://senior.ceng.metu.edu.tr/2016/teamrocket/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>throwback: My Summer Internship Project: Object Manipulation with NAO Humanoid Robot</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;In 2014, I did my summer internship in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.kovan.ceng.metu.edu.tr/index.php/Main_Page&quot;&gt;KOVAN Research Lab&lt;/a&gt; that is the best robotic lab in Turkey and well-known in Europe. At the end of my summer internship, I have decided to work in academia since KOVAN Research Lab gave me initial spark for science -especially AI-.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have worked with NAO Humanoid Robot for three months. In my project, NAO moved objects out of the area that borders were marked with a tape. Movable objects were carried by NAO itself. However, for objects that NAO could not move, it looked for a human for assistance. NAOâ€™s aim was clearing the area by moving objects outside of borders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can see the project report &lt;a href=&quot;../../../../../../Summer_Practice_Report.pdf&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/bozcani/Object-Manipulation-with-NAO-Humanoid-Robot&quot;&gt;Code&lt;/a&gt; is available.&lt;/p&gt;
