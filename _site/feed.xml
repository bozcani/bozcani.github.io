        <title>throwback: My Summer Internship Project: Object Manipulation with NAO Humanoid Robot</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;In 2014, I did my summer internship in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.kovan.ceng.metu.edu.tr/index.php/Main_Page&quot;&gt;KOVAN Research Lab&lt;/a&gt; that is the best robotic lab in Turkey and well-known in Europe. At the end of my summer internship, I have decided to work in academia since KOVAN Research Lab gave me initial spark for science -especially AI-.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have worked with NAO Humanoid Robot for three months. In my project, NAO moved objects out of the area that borders were marked with a tape. Movable objects were carried by NAO itself. However, for objects that NAO could not move, it looked for a human for assistance. NAOâ€™s aim was clearing the area by moving objects outside of borders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can see the project report &lt;a href=&quot;../../../../../../Summer_Practice_Report.pdf&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/bozcani/Object-Manipulation-with-NAO-Humanoid-Robot&quot;&gt;Code&lt;/a&gt; is available.&lt;/p&gt;
