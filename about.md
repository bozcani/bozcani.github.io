Currently, I am a MSc. student at computer engineering department([CEng](http://www.ceng.metu.edu.tr)) in METU and researcher at [KOVAN Research Lab](http://www.kovan.ceng.metu.edu.tr/index.php/Main_Page).

I am interested in learning in robotics and like designing computational models inspired from nature.

I am part-time amateur cross country skier, trail runner and every-time nature lover :)
