In 2014, I did my summer internship in [KOVAN Research Lab][kovan-lab] that is the best robotic lab in Turkey and well-known in Europe. At the end of my summer internship, I have decided to work in academia since KOVAN Research Lab gave me initial spark for science -especially AI-. 

I have worked with NAO Humanoid Robot for three months. In my project, NAO moved objects out of the area that borders were marked with a tape. Movable objects were carried by NAO itself. However, for objects that NAO could not move, it looked for a human for assistance. NAO's aim was clearing the area by moving objects outside of borders.

You can see the project report [here][summer-practice-report].
